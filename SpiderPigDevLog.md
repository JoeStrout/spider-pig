Jam is starting.  Not much time!  Thing that concerns me most initially is making a decent-looking city.  Discord user @Territorial (@Armen on the MiniScript server) is helping out.  Possible city tilesets we could try to adapt:

- https://craftpix.net/product/business-center-tileset-pixel-art/
- https://craftpix.net/product/residential-area-tileset-pixel-art
- https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-scrolling-city-backgrounds-pixel-art
- https://malser-gamedev.itch.io/town-city-tiled-background
- https://opengameart.org/content/8-bit-city-tile-set

I could also maybe adapt DYZE-tiles.png, from the DYZE project.  None of these are really ideal though.  Territorial may end up making custom tiles.

Other assets we might be able to use...

OK we have basic mechanics working.  I've created an itch.io page at https://joestrout.itch.io/spider-pig, though it's still secret (draft).  Game seems to play OK in the browser so far.
